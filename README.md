## Description
This project aims to perform a comprehensive Global Ecological Analysis, focusing on various aspects of the Earth's ecosystems, biodiversity, natural resources, and human impacts on the environment. The goal is to understand the complex interactions within and between natural and human systems to inform sustainable development and conservation efforts.

Key Components of Global Ecological Analysis
Ecosystem Assessment: Evaluating the structure, function, and services provided by various ecosystems such as forests, wetlands, oceans, and grasslands.
Biodiversity Monitoring: Tracking changes in species diversity, abundance, and distribution to understand the impacts of human activities and natural processes.
Natural Resource Management: Assessing the sustainable use and conservation of resources like water, soil, minerals, and fossil fuels.
Climate Change Impact: Studying the effects of climate change on ecosystems, species, and human communities, including temperature changes, sea-level rise, and extreme weather events.
Pollution Analysis: Investigating the sources, distribution, and impacts of pollutants such as plastics, chemicals, and greenhouse gases on the environment and human health.
Land Use and Land Cover Change: Analyzing changes in land use patterns and their effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.
Human-Environment Interactions: Understanding how human activities like agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization affect natural systems and how these changes feedback into human societies.
Conservation Strategies: Developing and evaluating strategies to protect and restore ecosystems and biodiversity, including protected areas, restoration projects, and sustainable practices.
Socio-Economic Factors: Considering the social, economic, and cultural dimensions of ecological issues to ensure that solutions are equitable and feasible.
Policy and Governance: Analyzing existing environmental policies and governance structures to recommend improvements for better ecological outcomes.


Data Manipulation: The Pandas library was used to read and process the CSV file containing the SDGi data.

Web Scraping: Mechanical soup was used to scrape information from https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/

Map Creation: The Folium library was used to create an interactive map with circle markers representing different countries and their respective SDGi values. Launch with 

File Handling: Python was used to read the existing HTML file, insert the generated map HTML content into it, and save the combined result to a new HTML file.
HTML
Webpage Structure: The HTML file serves as the structure of the webpage where the interactive map is displayed.
Placeholder for Map: An HTML comment (<!-- Insert map here -->) was used as a placeholder in the existing HTML file to mark where the generated map HTML content should be inserted.


This analysis encompasses various aspects of the Earth's ecosystems, biodiversity, natural resources, and human impacts on the environment. Our goal is to understand the complex interactions within and between natural and human systems to inform sustainable development and conservation efforts.
